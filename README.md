Finally it's here! We are going to do some hard work to complete the front end of our Get Things Done app. Since you already went through a warmup exercise in the previous section, you should have no issues working on this one. 


You have the following goals:

1. Complete the task by clicking on the checkbox
1. Render line through completed tasks
1. Delete assignment
1. Show the number of ACTIVE assignments
1. Add task via the input and make it active

This is a short demo of what we expect from the application functionality:
